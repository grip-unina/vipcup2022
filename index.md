This year the VIP Cup competition will be focused on distinguishing real versus AI-based content in images.
Teams are requested to design a strategy for synthetic image detection by relying on image processing and machine learning techniques.

### Challenge Organization

Specifically, competitors are asked to work in the challenging scenario where it is not known the method used to generate synthetic data.
While there are many forensic detectors with good generalization and robustness abilities, 
less attention in the literature has been devoted to detect synthetic images in a realistic setting, where the test data comprises: 
* both fully synthetic images and partially manipulated ones, 
* generative models that comprise not only GANs, but also more recent diffusion-based models.

Being able to discriminate synthetic images, fully and partially synthetic, vs pristine ones can represent a step forward to the advancement of forensics tools.
